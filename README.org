** Details
   
   Just as basic-theme says:

   The theme attempts to reduce the usage of colors to a minimum based on my
   personal preferences. It's not fully monochrome, for example diffs, comments, active regions and keywords are distinguished via colors and contrary to basic-theme this theme assumes font-lock, i.e. =(global-font-lock-mode 1)=.
